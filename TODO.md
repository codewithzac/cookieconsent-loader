## What's left to do?
Here's a list of the things I'd like to get to at some point:

- Use a different code editor with better linting options (CSS linting in particular)
- Test this plugin in combination with optimisation plugins; what breaks and what can be fixed?
- Add controls for prioritising when the scripts and styles are enqueued

I'll add to / remove from this list as things evolve :)
